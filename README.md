- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sean-Sweeney, a sophomore at The University of Maryland studying computer science.
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of computer science with many fields! (Especially Augmented Reality!)
      Here's a few:
      transportation infrastructure
      real estate development
      edge manufacturing
      product development
      drones    
- 📚 I love tackling hard problems and delivering a jump in productivity and/or creativity for end users
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
      object oriented design patterns
      advanced data structures
      vanilla JavaScript
      how to deploy applications on AWS (soooo many things 😂)
      better requirements and demand elicitation techniques
      how to raise 🐤
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects:
      with savvy and kind people
      geared towards AR
      or wacky moonshoots that push the boundaries of what's possible
